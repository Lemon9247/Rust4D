# Agent Pre-Split Report
**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Agent**: Pre-Split
**Task**: Create Phase 0 and Phases 1-5 planning documents for the engine roadmap synthesis

---

## What I Created

### 1. `scratchpad/plans/engine-roadmap-2026/split-phase-0-foundation.md`

Detailed planning document covering the 5 pre-ECS foundation tasks identified by Agent F. For each task, the document includes specific files to modify, implementation approach, session estimates, dependencies, and verification criteria.

**Key content:**
- **Task 1: Rotor4 Serialization** (0.25 session, BLOCKING) -- Add Serialize/Deserialize derives, remove the Transform4D workaround module. Includes the RON format breaking change note (array to struct fields).
- **Task 2: Physics Type Serialization** (deferred) -- Cascade of ~8 types documented. Recommended to defer to Phase 2 of the split plan since these types will be restructured during ECS migration.
- **Task 3: Fixed Timestep** (0.5 session) -- Accumulator pattern for PhysicsWorld. Currently physics is frame-rate dependent.
- **Task 4: Diagonal Movement Normalization** (0.1 session) -- 41-73% faster diagonal movement in 4D (sqrt(3) multiplier with 3 movement axes). One-line fix with length check.
- **Task 5: Back-Face Culling** (0.1 session) -- Disabled for debugging, never re-enabled. Risk of winding order issues in the compute shader.
- **Total estimate: ~1 session** (down from the synthesis's original 2 sessions, because Partial ECS was superseded by full ECS)
- **Parallelization notes**: All tasks are independent; could be 4 parallel agents but small enough for one session.

### 2. `scratchpad/plans/engine-roadmap-2026/split-phases-1-5.md`

Summary reference document pointing to the full split plan at `scratchpad/plans/2026-01-30-engine-game-split.md`. Covers:

- Architecture diagrams (current state to target state, from the split plan)
- Phase summary table with session estimates (9.5-14 total)
- Key milestones per phase
- Verification criteria per phase
- Key decisions already made (hecs, git URL hybrid deps, rust4d_game scope, collision presets stay in engine, input action/axis abstraction)
- Risks and considerations (hecs API differences, test porting effort, RenderableGeometry coupling, two-repo maintenance, CharacterController4D fidelity)
- Post-split enablement table showing what each feature phase gains from the completed split

## Source Documents Used

1. `scratchpad/reports/2026-01-30-engine-roadmap/agent-f-report.md` -- Primary source for Phase 0
2. `scratchpad/plans/2026-01-30-engine-game-split.md` -- Primary source for Phases 1-5
3. `scratchpad/reports/2026-01-30-engine-roadmap/hive-mind.md` -- Cross-phase coordination notes, key findings from all agents
4. `scratchpad/reports/2026-01-30-multi-engine-review/cross-swarm-synthesis.md` -- Original integrated roadmap for context

## Design Decisions

- **Kept Phase 0 actionable**: Each task has exact file paths, line numbers, and code snippets. An implementing agent can pick this up and start coding immediately.
- **Kept Phases 1-5 as a summary**: The full split plan is already comprehensive at 400+ lines. Duplicating it would create maintenance burden. The summary captures the structure and cross-references the original.
- **Included the "What This Enables" connections**: Each phase summary shows what downstream work it unblocks, connecting the split plan to the post-split feature phases.
