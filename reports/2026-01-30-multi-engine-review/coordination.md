# Queen's Coordination: Engine Review for 4D Boomer Shooter
**Date**: 2026-01-30

## Objective
Comprehensive review of the Rust4D engine from three perspectives:
1. Current codebase state (features, architecture, testing)
2. Long-term roadmap feasibility
3. Feature gap analysis vs established game engines and the boomer shooter genre

Goal: Build a roadmap for a feature-rich 4D boomer shooter like Doom.
